#For all questions, type the code below the quesiont. Clearly print results 
#that evidences that your code performs the assigned task.

#1. Create a function that calculates the length of a list without using len()
# and returns this value. Create a list and pass it to the function to find its 
# length.

#2. Create a function that performs dot multiplication on two vectors (lists), 
# such that if list1 = [x1,x2,x3] and list2 = [y1,y2,y3], 
# dot_product_list1_list2 = [x1y1, x2y2, x3y3] and returns this list. 
#Pass two lists of the same length to this function.

#3. In a single line, pass two lists of the same length to the function from
# question 2 and pass the instance of that function to the function from 
# question 1. What is the length of dot_product_list1_list2?

#4. Create two unique lists using generator functions and pass them to the
# function created in question 2.

#5. Create a function that checks the types of elements in a list. For example,
# if a list contains a string, an integer, and a float, this function should 
# return a list that contains identifies these three types: [str, int, float]

#6. In a single line, pass a list with at least 4 different to the function 
# from question 5 and pass the result to the funciton measuring length.
