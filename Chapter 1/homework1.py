1. Record your name in an object (x = ...) and a description of yourself in 
another object. 

2. Raise 2 to the 4th power. Save the value in an object named twoToTheFourth. 
Then create a new value that sums the value twice. Create another variable that 
saves the value of twoToTheFourth as a string. Just as with the numeric value, 
sum the string object twice.

3. Find the list of escape sequences in section 2.4:
    https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#literals
    create a string that uses at least 4 different escape sequences.
